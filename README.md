# BeZen-Data-Engineer-Assignment
Bezen Data Engineer Assignment.ipynb contains the solutions to questions of assignment. Pandas library is used which can be installed with the following command

"pip install pandas"

main.py is a python file which is generating an overall report of the dataset. The output file is report.html which gives the detailed overview of the dataset.

How to run the files?
.ipynb can be viewed directly in the github. To make changes, you need to download that file in a folder which contains csv file and run the .ipynb file with jupyter/ VScode

main.py can be compiled with the VS code. the code is visible here itself. The output file , Report.html, is however uploaded.
Download report.html to view it in any browser. It can not be seen on github directly due to its large size, hence it is needed to be downloaded.
